COEN 177 Operating Systems

Final
  - Everything after The midterm
  - Page replacement algorithms

Lying is bad... except in system software

Research assignments:
Really any topic you'd like
  - related to operating systems
  - Waffle file system

Inodes

Is it useful?

IO - Blocks on disk

WRITE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ON THE TEST
NOT COMPREHENSIVE
ONLY MATERIALS FROM PAGE REPLACEMENT
  - allocation problems on file systems
  - same general concepts applied to a new domain

Security material: no recall

Review session: tuesday early afternoon

Permissions
  - reading anything at your level and below
  - writing: write for your security level or above
    = has to do with integrity
    = don't allow somebody the ability to change something

Ethics:
Security

Trapdoors & Backdoors
  - Good or bad? It depends

The Logic Bomb

Server-Based DRM
  - Selling license to use software

Cold Passwords

Caching Data

Exploiting Vulnerability
  - Terms of service, who owns the device you're accessing
  - How it's used vs how it can be used vs how it's intended to be used

File Block Data Caches
  - Don't cache entire files, cache disk blocks
  - Cache recently/most used portions that are read
  - Local vs global allocation
  - Block replacement - LRU linked list would work, or circular
    = but need to be able to find the blocks in memory
  - LRU list of blocks, extra pointers to the blocks

Other topics for reports
  - venti/waffle
  - I/O -> shingled magnetic write disks

  - thick lines, but write overlapping to give thin lines
    = Write a track followed by tracks overlapped
    = slower to write data in the same location

  - I/O Domain
  -Security
    = The standard c library is turing complete
    = Buffer overflow injections
    = Return oriented

    = Authentication methods
    = Randomness - random isn't random - clock biases
  - Disk scheduling/allocation

  *****Find the source and critique it
    - review of the topic that interests you
    - 1-2 page report
    - What's the core thesis?
    - How well do they satisfy the thesis? Motivate?


Stack Algorithms
  How is modeling done?

  Belady's anomaly
    - reduce teh number of page faults by supplying more memory
    - Sometimes (with the same pages) you can have more faults with more memory
    - Mostly on stack algorithms
    - order independent of amount of ram the system has
