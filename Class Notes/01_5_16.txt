OS
	-program that runs on the "raw" hardware
	-resource manager
		-each program gets time with the resource
		-each program gets space on the resource
	-standardizes interface across different tyes of hardware: extended machine
	-hides teh messy details wich must be performed
	-presents user with a virtual machine, easier to use
	-may have potentially conflicting goals:
		-use hardware efficiently
		-give maximum performance to each user

1st Generation
	-direct input
	-Run one job at a time

3rd gen
	-multiprogramming
	-multiple jobs in memory, protected from one another
	-resources split between jobs
	-still not interactive -> user submits job, computer runs it, user gets results minutes (hours, days) later

Timesharing
	
Storage Pyramid

Operating System Concepts
	-Processes (and trees of processes)
	-Deadlock
	-File systems and directory trees
	-pipes -> won't talk about them
		-communication as more of a general concept
	-what files look like

Processes
	-program in execution
	-process creates a process
	-address space (memory) the program can use
	-state (registers, including program counter & stack pointer)
	-Os keeps track of all processes in a process table
	-processes can create other processes
		-process tree tracks these relationships
